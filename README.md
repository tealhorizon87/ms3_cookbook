## UX
This is a flask/Python web application, using MongoDB to store the backend data. The design is inspired from the myriad examples of online recipe guides already online, but few allow the user to upload their own recipes and share them with the greater online community.

### User Stories
User stories regarding the application in general:
  - As a new user, I want -
    - to easily understand the purpose of the site without further navigation
    - to be able to search the site without having to create an account
    - (if I decide to register) to have a personal page where my own entries will be clearly displayed

  - As a returning user, I want to be able to -
    - search for recipes by name, category, or ingredient
    - add a new recipe to the application with a simple form
    - edit my own recipes when necessary
    - keep my recipe private if I don't want others to see it
    - comment on other people's recipes to provide useful feedback of how it works

User stories regarding the recipes themselves:
  - As a user, I want -
    - to be able to see information about cooking times, difficulty and user rating
    - to see the ingredients listed in a clear way
    - to see if the recipe fulfils my dietary needs
    - clear and concise steps to complete the recipe

As the application owner, I want -
  - to encourage people to sign up for an account to allow for better owner/user interaction
  - to have the opportunity to promote cookware or other applications relevant to the section the user is viewing

### Design
This application is web-based, utilising several HTML templates to create, display, edit and delete recipes from the database. The home screen is useable by everyone, but certain functions such as adding new recipes and commenting on other users' recipes are restricted to registered users.
The recipes themselves are displayed such that information about the recipe is at the top, followed by ingredients and equipment, then cooking instructions. A comments box is below each recipe (for registered users) to allow users to interact with the recipe author.

The font families used for the application are [font name] for all headings, [font name] for main body text, and [font name] for decorative text. All fonts have been sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

The colour scheme for the site has been taken from several of the photos used as backgrounds for the site. The colours are indicative of rustic cuisine, and should enhance the users' experience of the site. The palette was generated by [coolors](https://coolors.co/) and are as follows:
